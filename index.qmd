# Hello, welcome to my world! 

I am Monica Ghosh, a Masters student in the Systems Biology and Bioinformatics program at Case Western Reserve University, Ohio.  

By training, I am a Cell & Molecular Biologist in the field of cardiovascular research, through my PhD at Kent State University, Ohio. I have a strong foundation in conducting complex projects, troubleshooting, and analyzing big data.
Through this degree, I wish to gain the analytical and programming skills to step into the domain of translational research where I can cater to a bigger audience. 

My passion lies in teaching and I have taught undergraduate Microbiology and Biochemistry classes at Kent State University and University of Calcutta in India. For me, teaching is my way of giving back to the world by helping to make a smarter and brighter society.

Do check out my other happy corner in the 'Interest' section, where I share my love for painting and crafting new recipes for my blog on Instagram [thekolkatacook](https://www.instagram.com/thekolkatacook/). 

Feel free to connect with me [here](mailto:mxg979@case.edu).
