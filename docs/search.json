I have a strong foundation in conducting complex projects, troubleshooting, and analyzing big data. Through this degree, I wish to gain the analytical and programming skills to step into the domain of translational research where I can cater to a bigger audience.\nMy passion lies in teaching and I have taught undergraduate Microbiology and Biochemistry classes at Kent State University and University of Calcutta in India. For me, teaching is my way of giving back to the world by helping to make a smarter and brighter society.\nDo check out my other happy corner in the ‘Interest’ section, where I share my love for painting and crafting new recipes for my blog on Instagram thekolkatacook.\nFeel free to connect with me here.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
